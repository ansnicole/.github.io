	<H2>The Personality Test</H2>
	<p>The first personality test was developed by Kathrine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers
	and it was released in 1943. Briggs' theory about personality types began when Isabel's husband expressed 
	views of the world that were much different than anyone elses. Briggs and Myers decided to take their theory
	to the next level and begin researching and developing a questionnaire to test their theory. This test was
	called the MBTI questionnaire, and it is still available to take today! The MBTI test has even been translated into
	14 different languages. Nowadays there are thousands of personality tests available to the public online. I personally took
	a personality test, and I found out that I am a Consul/ESFJ personality type. The following paragraphs and table
	will explain why personality types are important and what it means to be a ESFJ personality type.
	
	<H2>Why Should People Learn About Their Personality Type?</H2>
		<p>Personality types can tell us a <em>plethora</em> of information about people, their tendencies, and give us
		a good idea about what kind of environment they perform best in. From a career perspective, personality tests
		can provide individuals with guidance to the right career for them. The test results direct you towards career paths 
		that suit your personality type best in terms of where you would most likely be naturally happy 
		(based on the environment) and where you are best suited to fulfill the types of tasks. Knowing your 
		personality type can also help you navigate personal relationships; effective communication skills are
		among the most important relationship benefits that come with finding out your personality type. Knowing
		how your mind works can help you understand how you learn best and what studying strategies work best for
		you. Being aware of your personality type allows you to be more self-aware, and can even help you better
		understand other people.</p>

		<p>People with the Consul personality type possess a noteable balance of both characteristics in each of the 
		different categories (mind, energy, nature, tactics, and identity). People with ESFJ personality type experience 
		a sense of connection with others and find it fairly easy to engage and interact with others. They long to
		feel as though they "belong" in society, which helps motivate them to hold an active role in society. 
		The characteristics under the energy and nature category go hand in hand; ESFJ personality types not only
		tend to utilize their observations more so than their intuition, but they also tend to turn to their feelings 
		more so than thinking. This exemplifies the sensitivity of Consuls in that they take feelings and observations 
		into heavy consideration when making decisions in order to please everyone. Moreover, Consul personality types tend
		to have a close balance of being judging and prospecting; judging in terms of personality means that the individual
		is very focused and determined when it comes to work and other challenges, while prospecting in terms
		of personality means that the individual is in a much more relaxed and pliable state when there are tasks at hand.
		ESFJ personalities, as a result of having a close balance of both traits, tend to experience extremes of both characteristics
		depending on the situation that they are in. Finally, Consul personalities are prone to being slightly more turbulent
		than assertive, which makes sense considering that these individuals have stronger ties to their feelings than
		thinking. This again shows how ESFJ personalities are more sensitive and take others feelings into consideration when 
		making important decisions. To learn more about the Consul personality type click <A href="https://www.16personalities.com/esfj-personality">here</A></p>
